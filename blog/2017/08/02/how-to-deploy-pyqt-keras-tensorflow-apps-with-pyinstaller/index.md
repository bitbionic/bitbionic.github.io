# How to deploy PyQt, Keras, Tensorflow apps with PyInstaller

I recently needed to figure out how to deploy a Keras application on Windows 10 without requiring someone to know how to install Python and all of the dependencies for the application. This video shares what I learned in the process, showing how to deploy a Python app with many third party dependencies into a single deployment package complete with executable.

I hope this is helpful to anyone wanting to deploy Python as an executable.
