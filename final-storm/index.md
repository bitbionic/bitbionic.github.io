# Final Storm
> Final Storm is a cross-platform twin-stick shooter. It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 5-10 minutes when you just want to shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible and pickup a few power-ups along the way (..ahem.. you'll need them)
