# Final Storm
> Final Storm is a cross-platform twin-stick shooter. It's designed as a pickup game you can play in 5-10 minutes when you just want to shoot a lot of bullets and dodge just as many. Survive as many waves as possible and pickup a few power-ups along the way (..ahem.. you'll need them)

# System Requirements
This game does not require a cutting edge system. It was developed and tested on an old laptop from 2012. It does spray a lot of bullets though and the more horsepower your computer has, the smoother the experience is guaranteed to be. That said here are some specs:

## Minimum Specs
 * Any Intel 2nd generation i5 or i7 or comparable AMD processor produced since 2012 running Windows 7,8,10, OSX or Linux.
 * 4 GB RAM (Does anyone have less than 4 GB now? The application MAY run with less but has not been tested under those conditions)
 * Updated OpenGL graphics drivers. The engine uses OpenGL 2.0 which most graphics cards within the last 7 years should be compatible with.
## Recommended Specs thatâ€™ll make the game Sing with Joy
 * Any Intel i5 or i7 or comparable AMD since 2012
 * 8 GB of RAM or more
 * NVIDIA 660 or higher or comparable AMD
